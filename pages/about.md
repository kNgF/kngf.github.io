# About Me

What's Up, Dear Reader. I'm Faisal Husaini, 21, from India, a student and a infosec learner interesting in penetration testing and red teaming, also play CTFs and games for fun. Currently I have worked for 2 companies regarding web app and mobile app penetration testing. Been into the field since 5 years , currently I still make sure to make internet a safer place and secure web and mobile apps of clients. Looking forwardly, I am interested in learning low level hacking like binary exploitation and reverse engineering etc. Apart from that, I am a part time game and infosec streamer at <b> Arkanoid </b>
